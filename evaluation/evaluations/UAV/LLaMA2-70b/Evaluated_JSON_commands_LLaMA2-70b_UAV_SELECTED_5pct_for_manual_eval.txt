However, the angular_velocity given in the command (55 degrees per second) doesn\'t match the one in the JSON (0.5). The angle in the command (450 degrees) isn\'t considered reasonable because typically rotation angles are within the range of 0-360 degrees.

However, the ""duration"" in the first JSON object is converted to seconds (15 minutes = 900 seconds) correctly, but the speed and duration values in the second JSON object do not match the mentioned values in the command (2 kilometers should have been converted to seconds, not 2000). The direction ""ahead"" does not correspond to a specific direction like the ontology\'s ""north"". Consequently, the match is not perfect.']"

The speed parameter is also correctly represented. However, the direction value ""straight"" in the JSON does not have a direct equivalent in the available keys. The distance value and its unit are not included in the keys in the given sample ontology, but the conversion of 2 miles to 3200 feet is mathematically accurate.

A more correct approach would be to omit the ""altitude"" parameter or assign it a reasonable default value, as per the ""If a parameter\'s value is not specified in the natural language command, any reasonable value in the JSON is accepted"" rule.
