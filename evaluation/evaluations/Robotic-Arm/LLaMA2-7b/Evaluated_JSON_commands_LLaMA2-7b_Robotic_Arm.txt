Fold the elbow joint to a 45-degree angle and sustain the pose for 5 seconds., Note: You can assume that the arm's length is 0 centimeters initially.;['3; The natural language command asks to move the elbow joint to an angle of 45 degrees, which corresponds to the JSON structure for the action "move_joint", but the command also specifies maintaining the pose for a duration of 5 seconds which does not correspond to any keys in this structure.

Rotate the arm horizontally by 180 degrees., Note: You can assume that the arm's length is 0 centimeters initially.;['1; The provided command involves moving a joint of the arm, which somewhat matches with the "move_joint" action from the sample ontology.

Rotate the arm sideways, making it complete a 180-degree turn., Note: You can assume that the arm's length is 0 centimeters initially.;['1; The command requests to rotate the arm sideways for 180 degrees.

Perform a horizontal rotation of the arm, spanning 180 degrees., Note: You can assume that the arm's length is 0 centimeters initially.;['1; The command mentions moving the arm (potentially through "move_joint" action) but the motion\'s specifics such as the exact joint, direction of the rotation, speed of the rotation, and the unit of measurement do not conform exactly with the JSON structure provided.

Twist the arm horizontally, ensuring it moves precisely 180 degrees., Note: You can assume that the arm's length is 0 centimeters initially.;['2; The natural language command partially matches with the JSON structure.
