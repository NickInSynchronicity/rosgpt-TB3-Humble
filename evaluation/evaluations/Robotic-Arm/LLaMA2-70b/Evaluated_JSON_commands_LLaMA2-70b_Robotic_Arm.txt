Hold the object with a grip that exerts 8 kilograms of force for 10 seconds.,{ "action": "grip_object"  "params": {   "force": {     "type": "float"      "value": 8.0}    "duration": {     "type": "float"      "value": 10.0}    "unit_force": "kilograms"    "unit_duration": "seconds"}};['2; The action in the command matches with the action in the JSON structure.

Move the arm back by 15 centimeters at a speed of 2 centimeters per second.,No JSON;['0; The given command mentions "moving the arm back," which does not correspond to any action in the available JSON structures.

Withdraw the arm, reducing its length by 15 centimeters, while moving at a rate of 2 centimeters per second.,No JSON;['0; The provided command involves withdrawing or reducing the length of the arm, which is not described in any of the provided JSON structures.
