The command does not specify the direction (i.e. "is_forward"), but since the command is to "proceed straight", this can be interpreted as moving forward, which fits with "is_forward": True in the JSON structure. The "linear_speed" parameter is not specified in the command, but the sample value of 0.5 in the JSON structure is a reasonable value.
