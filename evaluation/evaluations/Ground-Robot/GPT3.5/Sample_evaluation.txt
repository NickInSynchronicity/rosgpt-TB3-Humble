The action of rotation and the ""angular_velocity"" are correct, however, the ""angle"" and the direction of the turn (being counterclockwise or not) are not mentioned in the natural language command, so this can\'t be assumed. The second JSON structure also partially matches the command in the rotation but incorrectly includes a distance parameter that is not mentioned in the command. Additionally, the unit is slightly incorrect with ""meters"" in the JSON while the command mentions ""meter"". The durations parameter is missing in the JSON.']"

The command does correspond to the ""move"" action, the ""linear_speed"" matches, and the ""is_forward"" boolean makes sense, but the parameter for ""distance"" should not be provided as it was not specified in the command.']"
