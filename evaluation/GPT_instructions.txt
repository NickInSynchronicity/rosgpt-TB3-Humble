I want to create an ontology that converts natural language commands to a robot into a JSON structure of this type:

{
"action": "go_to_goal",
"params": {
"location": {
"type": "str",
"value": "Kitchen"
}
}
}
{
"action": "move",
"params": {
"linear_speed": 0.5,
"distance": distance,
"is_forward": True
"unit": "meter"
}
}
{
"action": "rotate",
"params": {
"angular_velocity": 0.35,
"angle": 40,
"is_clockwise": is_clockwise
"unit": "degrees"
}
}

Propose 3 ontologies for the following 3 use-cases:
1) Ground robot
2) UAV
3) Robotic arm

----------------------------------------------------

Provide 5 commands of this type for a ground robot, each formulated in 3 different wordings:
- "Move 1 meter forward for two seconds."
- "Rotate clockwise by 45 degrees."
- "Turn right and move forward for 3 meters."
- "Go to the kitchen and stop."
